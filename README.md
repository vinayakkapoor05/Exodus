# Exodus - A Space Survival Platformer  

## Game Overview  
**Exodus** is a thrilling 2D vertical platformer where you control a rocket fleeing the unstoppable blast of a supernova. Navigate through celestial hazards, conserve limited resources, and strategically interact with cosmic bodies to ascend as high as possible while staying ahead of the devastating explosion.

## Gameplay Features  

### Game Elements  

- **Rocket (Player's Vehicle):**  
  - **Thrust:** Limited energy drives upward movement.  
  - **Health:** Reduced by collisions or environmental hazards. Restored through specific interactions.  
  - **Energy:** Powers thrust; regenerates slowly and can be restored by celestial bodies.  

- **Celestial Bodies and Hazards:**  
  - **Planets:** Orbit these to gain speed boosts. Escape before the orbit radius degrades to avoid a fatal crash.  
  - **Moons:** Safe zones that regenerate health and temporarily pause the supernova.  
  - **Stars:** Restore energy but deal gradual damage if approached too closely. Similar to planets, escape orbit to avoid destruction.  
  - **Black Holes:** Strong gravitational pulls that deplete energy and challenge escapes, offering massive momentum boosts if navigated successfully.  
  - **Asteroids:** Destructible obstacles that reduce health on collision but grant points and restore health when destroyed.  
  - **Supernova:** A constant upward-moving threat; if it catches the rocket, the game ends.

### Abilities and Actions  

- **Orbit Escape:** Boosts speed when leaving a celestial body's pull.  
- **Asteroid Defense:** Destroy asteroids using bullets fired with the mouse.

### Controls  

#### Movement:  
- **W:** Thrust upward.  
- **A/D:** Move left or right.  

#### Interaction:  
- **E:** Escape orbit.  
- **Mouse:** Aim and shoot.  
- **Left-click:** Fire bullets.

## How to Play  

1. **Navigate Safely:** Use gravitational pulls to save energy and gain speed. Exit orbit zones before they degrade.  
2. **Manage Resources:** Conserve energy and maintain health by interacting with moons and stars.  
3. **Destroy Obstacles:** Shoot asteroids for points and health recovery.  
4. **Avoid Hazards:** Steer clear of black holes and time your orbits around celestial bodies.

## Winning and Losing  

- **Win:** As an endless platformer, the goal is to ascend as high as possible for a maximum score.  
- **Lose:**  
  - Rocket health depletes to zero.  
  - Supernova catches up.  
  - Crashes into planets or stars due to orbit failure.

## Tips for Survival  

1. **Orbit Strategically:** Use planets and black holes for momentum boosts but exit carefully.  
2. **Keep Moving:** Donâ€™t linger too long near celestial hazards or in gravitational pulls.  
3. **Destroy Asteroids:** Focus on clearing your path and boosting your score.  
4. **Utilize Safe Zones:** Land on moons whenever possible to pause the supernova and recover health.
